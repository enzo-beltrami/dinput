# Dinput - a dynamic input based on Dmenu

So i dont really know what i'm doing but i'm trying to adapt dmenu into an input to keep a standard on my scrips.

Right now i've removed the  match functions to keep the dmenu from drawing the list.

I dont really know C so i'm trying my best to adapt this.

## How to install:
```
sudo make install
```

## Usage
```
echo "" | dinput
```

i'm trying to remove the need of the `echo "" |`
